## Social Anthropology 314
# Reading and Doing Ethnography

### 2018 — Quarter 1

## General Description

This module is an introduction to reading and doing ethnography. In anthropology, ethnography refers both to what we do (conducting ethnographic fieldwork) and to what we write (ethnographies) after we return from “the field.” During the course, you will read ethnographies and readings on research methods. The aim is to understand how ethnographic research is conducted, analysed and written up. Through lectures and readings, you will learn about the different approaches to ethnography that have developed over time, and about anthropologists’ debates around the practice and politics of ethnography.

You will try out some of what you learn in class by conducting your own ethnographic fieldwork during the term on a topic of your choice. You will choose a research question that can be answered by doing a small research exercise in an easily accessible and everyday site. In this way you will ideally be able to regularly spend time there throughout the term. But you are not expected to do a lengthy period of fieldwork and the challenge will be to keep this research exercise manageable.

You will also produce a series of short ethnographic analyses about your research where you wrestle with the challenge of interpreting the rich and complex slice of life in which you have been involved and communicating this to others through ideas, stories, images, and/or sounds.

## About Ethnography

Ethnography, etymologically, is *writing about people*.

> Ethnography is the disciplined and deliberate witness-cum-recording of human events.
-— Paul Willis and Mats Trondman

> Eliciting the subject’s ethnography is likely to be spurred by a sympathy for, or at least some cognizance of, the subject’s concerns. And here the anthropologist’s status as an outsider can be a real asset. Certainly, the outsider is ignorant. But the outsider does not have to pretend to knowledge or compete for expert status. The outsider is free to be a fool (and hence to become wiser).
-— David A. Westbrook

### Some preliminary considerations for beginning ethnographers:

**The self is an instrument**: Every science involves instruments, but one of the peculiarities of ethnography is that the researcher her- or himself becomes the instrument of data collection. Ethnographic observation therefore cannot be entirely routinized, since it is always shaped by your own processes of perception, which in turn emerge from your own biography and social origins. This does not mean that every observation is “subjective” or arbitrary; on the contrary, ethnography shows us that experience and subjectivity are themselves products of society and history.

**Cultural worlds are vast, and they exceed us**: It is worth reminding ourselves that, although ethnographic investigation can produce vast quantities of good data, there is no way to capture everything. Your senses are limited: you can’t hear everything, you can’t see everything, you can’t be everywhere at once. And the very act of documenting your field experience takes time — during which you will likely have to stop observing and start documenting. Rather than lamenting the impossibility of ethnographic omniscience, we will talk about developing a practical sense of what kind of data is “enough,” and what kinds of uncertainty are worth accepting.

**There can be no methods without a project**: One of my own frustrations in methods classes was that they would ask us to “go out and observe” in a random park, coffeeshop, etc. This really makes no sense, because in the absence of some project that guides our attention, there is no way to choose what to pay attention to. For this course, you need not try to accomplish your life’s work, but you should pick a research question that you find interesting and that you care about.

## Aims and objectives

By the end of the course, students will:

- Understand what ethnography is, and its place in anthropology,
- Understand the essential connection between theory, ethnography and praxis in anthropology,
- Be familiar with some of the major trends, theoretical approaches and representational strategies to ethnography over the past century,
- Be able to identify key debates and disputes in the practice of writing ethnography,
- Have conducted their own ethnographic fieldwork and produced an ethnographic representation of their research.

[TBA]

## Language Specification: E Module

All lectures will be presented in English and the reading materials for the course are also only provided in English. The tutors do have an understanding of Afrikaans and students are allowed to submit work in Afrikaans if they choose to do so.


## Course Policies

### General policies

- All reading materials, assignments, and due dates are communicated in this course outline and through SunLearn. We expect students to read through the course outline carefully to note the dates and instructions for their assessments. We will not accept excuses claiming ignorance of any information presented in this course outline. We will not respond to emails inquiring about information already available in this course outline. Please refer to the SunLearn for regular updates.
- Plagiarism is a serious offense, and will be dealt with strictly, according to University of Stellenbosch policies. We thus expect you to be familiar with these policies before you submit any assignments (see SunLearn for the necessary documentation).

### Attendance

- Students must attend at least 75% of the lectures to receive participation credit. Attendance will be monitored throughout the course of the module. We request you send a formal email within the first week of classes to your tutor to indicate clashes. This will be taken into account for attendance monitoring purposes.
- We expect students to submit sick notes for classes missed (excluding clashes). Documentation needs to be presented within three days of the missed lecture otherwise it will be indicated as non-attendance.
- Tutorial attendance is compulsory.

### Written Work

- Every type of assessment is compulsory to complete for passing the module. Failure to submit any of the stipulated assignments or complete the tests will result in an incomplete mark which translates to an immediate fail.
- No late assignments without proper medical documentation will be accepted after due dates. Students should inform their tutors in advance should they not be able to submit their work. A maximum period of three days after the submission date will be allowed to present said documentation. Thereafter neither the documentation nor the assignment will be accepted.
- No email submissions will be accepted for any assignment. All assignments have to be submitted at the very latest on the deadline through the Assignment link on SunLearn.
- The deadlines present the final opportunity to submit your work. You are most welcome to submit earlier. The submission links will be opened in advance. We do not accept late assignments in the absence of official documentation.
- All submitted work must be typed. The following specifications apply: 1.5 spacing, and 12 point Times New Roman font.
- Make use of the Harvard referencing system for all formal essays but not for tutorial assignments. We expect full bibliographies and in-text referencing. See SunLearn for helpful documentation.

## Assessments

Marks will be calculated as follows:

- Reading reactions, attendance, participation (worth 10%)
- Tutorial exercises (5 total, worth 30%)
- Ethnographic papers (2 total, worth 60%)

### Reading Reactions, Attendance and Participation

You are required to post a coherent and interesting question about the readings on SunLearn in advance of each lecture. Your question may not be a duplicate of an existing question. Optionally, if you find yourself tempted to post a dupe of an existing question, you may instead post a brief answer to your classmate’s already posted question. When there are multiple readings for a day, you may choose which one you want to address.
Attendance at lectures and tutorials is required and will be monitored via SunLearn.


### Tutorial Exercises

During weeks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 you will have to submit a series of short, written ethnographic documents to your tutor. These are not formal academic papers. They do not need to have citations or a bibliography. They are intentionally supposed to be rough working field documents. We will provide specific guidance for each assignment.

The topics will be:

- Week 1 — Project Statement
- Week 2 — Observation Fieldnotes
- Week 3 — Interview Fieldnotes
- Week 5 — Notes on Social Strategies
- Week 6 — Ethnographic Critique

### Ethnographic Papers

Two ethnographic papers will be due during class, at the end of weeks 4 and 7, respectively. They will each count for 30% of your mark. Specific guidance for each paper will be issued on SunLearn.
