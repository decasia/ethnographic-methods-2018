- Low risks to you and to the research participants.
- You are truly interested in your site.

## What makes a **good** research question?

# Good research questions

- Address a puzzle.
- Clearly and precisely stated.
- Answerable with the tools and resources available.
- Relevant: other people care about the answer.
- Don't smuggle in gratuitous opinions of your own.

## Are all research questions good?

# Research questions that need work

- Why are men different from women? *[Impossibly broad, no clear site.]*
- Do Americans believe in destiny? *[Too broad, factual, no clear puzzle.]*
- Why do poor Americans vote against their economic interests? *[This implies that you know what their interests are, prior to doing research.]*
- How can ethnography can illuminate gender dynamics? *This is too nebulous.*

# Research questions that need work

- How are prices different at a farmers' market than in a supermarket?
- What is the physical layout of a (particular) bookstore?
- What attracts people to interfaith church services?

---

# Good research questions

- What does the word "oriental" mean to staff and visitors at an Oriental Institute?
- In a tense rural environment, how do recreational rock climbers perceive those outside their group?
- In a science exhibit where magical techniques and scientific facts interact as part of the educational process, how children are taught to delineate what science can and cannot share with magic?

## Research questions are not supposed to be finished or perfect. They're just a moment in a process.
