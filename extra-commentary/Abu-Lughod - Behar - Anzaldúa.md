# Abu-Lughod, Behar, Anzaldúa, Gluckman questions



## Cultural Backgrounds

-   What advice could Anzaldúa offer current Mexican immigrants living under Donald Trump? How did a culturally diverse (Spanish) background affect her in Texas?
-   Behar - How strongly does an anthropologists background affect the subjects they study? Behar is a Hispanic/Latina woman who studies Hispanic/Latina women. Is this a trend within modern anthropology as the departure from colonial anthropology continues?
-   Considering Anzaldúa has a Spanish heritage and grew up in The States, what advice could she offer current Mexican immigrants living in America under Donald Trump? How did a culturally diverse background affect her?
-   Abu-Lughod writes about a tale of two pregnancies while she mainly focuses on her own experience within the Egyptian compared to American pregnancy cultures. Is she egyptian or an american ?

We're all products of a specific social background. And anthropologists' backgrounds *always* affect the subjects they study. This is both normal and unavoidable.

But just *how* this process works varies immensely from one person to the next. We all have lots of identities, and some of them are more pertinent than others. For example, sometimes one's gender is really important in research. But other times a more specific kind of identity comes to the fore (like, do you have a common interest with a niche group you're studying?).

It's now considered normal in anthropology to acknowledge how your own identity affects your work, *if this is actually relevant to your work*. Notice that Abu-Lughod does not really talk about this the same way that Behar does.

Incidentally, Abu-Lughod is Palestinian. But I don't know any other specifics about how these scholars are affected by their respective heritages, other than what they tell us in their writing.

## Politics and feminism

-   I would like to know whether Anzaldua takes on the political stance of the Europeans in his writing about "the bridge we call home"?
-   Abu-Lughod writes about feminist ethnography, but I do not understand fully what she means by it. Does it simply refer to a study of women and "female-like-things" or does it refer to the "fight for womens rights" type of feminism? I am confused because I feel like the whole point of feminism is to show that women are capable of more than just bearing children and being wives, but in the end the reading suggests that having a child is all Abu-Lughod seemed to care about.

Anzaldúa's paper that we read is all about politics, but not so much regular governmental politics. It's about the politics of knowing -- about whose knowledge counts, whose knowledge is legitimate, and how we incorporate politics into our thinking. She is both writing from a broadly intersectional perspective as a Chicana and also critiquing reified identity categories (like "woman"). She even claims that these are obsolete and only still exist because they are employed by "those in power."

Abu-Lughod's feminist ethnography is closely related to Anzaldúa's form of politics. It isn't the kind of feminism that involves fighting for women's rights in the legal system. But yes, it's about making women and feminine practices into legit ethnographic research topics. It's also about insisting that less "objective-sounding" ways of writing are legitimate ways of doing anthropology -- insisting that personal experience of childbirth (which is very far from something you'd read in Gluckman) can be legit ways of exploring cultural difference.

Incidentally: Anzaldúa was a woman.

## Research Ethics

-   How difficult is it to remain ethical while write pieces/articles using your background and personal experiences?
-   Where does an anthropologist draw the line between reporting facts and saying something inappropriate and hurtful about someone else
-   Learning about low risks in class, if I were to have a project about something close to me and it will likely cause friction, like Belhar and her father, would that be considered a high risk as it complicates your life?
-   Behar's mother confronts her for not asking permission to use her parents as subjects in her ethnographic work. In cases where close family members are used as ethnographic subjects is consent required?
-   Does Anzaldua believe she has the right to write whatever she wants about her parents without their consent or knowledge on what will be published because they are related and therefore the concept of "others" does not apply to them? Does that speak of her as an anthropologist, or is this rather something she would have said to a psychologist as an "other"? In the sense that she does not seem to be objective or sensitive towards them, but is rather writing about HER life and HER subjective experiences of her parents
-   How difficult is it to remain ethical while writing a piece/article when using personal experiences/backgrounds? This is regarding your family, community, culture?

**How can you be ethical and subjective at once?** Personally, I actually think it's easier for subjective human beings to remain ethical than it would be for mechanical, non-subjective robots. You can program a robot (or a computer, or a bureaucracy) to follow all kinds of unethical scripts, and, lacking any sort of subjectivity, they will just execute them rotely. Whereas human beings may not always act ethically, but at least they have the capacity for ethical reflection.

Let's think about this from the perspective of the research subject. Have you ever gotten a really terrible, insulting question in a survey questionnaire? Where you want to complain, "no actually, this is a terrible question and you should be ashamed of yourselves for asking it!" This happens to me quite frequently. But you can't actually debate with the survey -- it's just a webpage or piece of paper. Whereas if the human researcher is in front of me asking the questions, we can actually make some progress on what is ethical and what isn't.

In short: Ethics isn't the same thing as objectivity. 

**Deciding what facts to report.** if some fact seems embarrassing or potentially problematic, you would want to ask yourself: "Why do I want to write about this?" "Is it necessary to my analysis?" "Could I use other data instead to make my point?" "What specific harm could this cause?" "What is the likelihood of the possible harm?" And then you attempt to balance between these sorts of different concerns, keeping in mind that human beings are more important than scholarly publications, generally speaking.

**Writing about your parents/personal experience.** Well, it's a very gray area. Generally people are considered to have an absolute general right to write autobiographically about their experiences. You may not have a lot of specialized academic knowledge about the world, but you know your own experiences, right? If you want to write about your experiences, it's on you to figure out whether that is a good idea, or will hurt someone. The question is: how well does this mix with professional anthropological writing? It gets very tricky, because the ethics of these two genres are considered very different. Note that I'm not answering this question directly, but rather agreeing that it is an important question.

I note that writing personally about your family may be somewhat different from writing personally about yourself. When Malinowski wrote about being alone and depressed, this was a personal disclosure, but it didn't disclose anything sensitive about a third person.

# Ethnographic relationships

-   With reference to the Abu-Lughod reading I would like to know how long she emerged herself in the Awlad 'Ali Beduin culture and also how long it took the women to no longer see her as an outsider but rather as a friend. I would also be interested to know how she approached the women to eventually befriend them.
-   In Gluckman's article, how did he get the Zulu people to trust him and open up to him?
-   How was Abu-Lughod able to transition from her lifestyle in the US to the place she stayed in Egypt?
-   I have more of a generalized question and an observation. Reading their experiences makes me wonder if subjectivity and being too attached to the community can have an impact on the ethnographers other research or even home life, and how can they de-attach themselves? For example with Abu-Lughod during her struggle to get pregnant she tried the Awlad 'Ali Bedouin women's fertility treatments. Then most of her focus when doing research and work in Egypt revolved around pregnancy and fertility.

**Building relationships**: Just as in other parts of life, it often takes quite a while to build a relationship with someone - perhaps months or years. It took me about a year of full-time research to start to have good field relations. But it's not just about time; closeness also emerges from being thrown together in some event. Geertz famously started making friends once he had to run away from the cops along with the locals. So it's not always just about "how long" it takes to build relations; it's also about what you go through together, or don't.

**Getting used to a different way of life**: I think it's part of our professional socialization that you should be able to give up your expectations about "normal life," since these are usually the product of your home culture. So one expects to get used to different technology, different rituals, different norms. Getting used to a foreign language can be quite hard as well, or at least it was for me. All this has an immense impact on your home life at the time, if you're doing full-time research, but afterwards -- in the classical foreign research scenario -- you can potentially just go home afterwards and resume your "home culture." This usually feels weird at the time (and a lot of major life events can happen during fieldwork).

## Researchers' families (particularly in Behar)

-   What is the link between Behar's situation of writing under her fathers name and social anthropology?
-   In terms of Behar, I found the article a little bit unanswered. As it raises interest in her writings but nothing is disclosed. Why, as an anthropologist would you study the roles of your family so long after it was a direct observable act. She documented the past, an as an anthropological account it confuses me how and why she would take such an approach. Is writing about family something that is frowned upon in the academic field and is it even a topic of broader concern? Esperanza is an interesting person who is pushed aside in this short piece, her part in the book makes sense to me as a reader, but the undisclosed business with her parents is somewhat confusing?
-   What is the link between the personal family situation of Behar and the study she did with Esperanza from her book?
-   Why did Behar choose to use her parents as the "other" in her writing?

Here's Behar explaining why she wrote about her family: "My book is about the life story of a peddler in Mexico. And my own grandfather was a peddler in Cuba, but Papi was always so ashamed of his origins that he couldn't even talk about it. Don't you think that's interesting?"

Sometimes people become anthropologists partly because they're trying to process their own trauma, their own shame, their own loss. Usually people don't talk about their families, but talking in *some* way about their circumstances of origin is a pretty common thing. It helps readers understand where you're coming from, and it might be therapeutic to write about. Usually it doesn't backfire in the same way that it did for Behar either -- I think that's why she ended up writing about the unexpected backlash.

## Creative writing

-   Both Anzaldua and Behar use creative techniques in the writing of their books. Is the creative writing techniques, such as poetic phrases and relaxed writing, a common feature in ethnography and the way Anthropologist write?
-   I just found the reading quiet autobiographical however, through understanding that its linked to theatre - I then got to grips with it. I struggled to read the piece due to it not being a "typical" form of ethnography however saw the link to ethnography it had. However, just wanted to clarify if this would also be classified as ethnographic work?
-   Abu-Lughod uses a much more story telling like format for her ethnography, and I wonder if she feels this paints a more accurate/relatable cultural picture than the thick ethnography/"objective" type that is used by Gluckman (as he describes details of events very directly)?
-   Looking at the Abu-Lughod reading, I was wondering does being subjective and being too emotionally invested in ones own personal life heavily impact the research? And if so how can it be avoided? I'm asking this because in the reading it said that when she was doing research in Egypt, she was using the Awlad women's fertility methods and experimenting with various other methods.

I would certainly classify Abu-Lughod and Behar's writing as ethnographic. It is a particular style of ethnographic writing -- a bit different from Gluckman's, obviously.

Creative writing is fine in ethnography. You should all try it! The question is: what are you trying to accomplish or convey? Once you settle that, it's easier to think about how to write. 

Being personally invested in the research isn't a bad thing. At the very least, you usually understand people better if you can empathize with them in some way. (It's not necessary to empathize with *everything about everybody*.)

## Fertility and childbirth

-   For Abu-Lughod: How did one remain open to two very different ways of fertility, pregnancy and birth, that being the traditonal ways of the women versus western medicine and procedures.
-   Even though technology has improved drastically in the times that Zaynab fell pregnant compared to when the Anthropologist did. Why does it seem that the Egyptians have better treatments for the blocking of infertility?
-   Did her subject have an influence on her own birth or did she just observe the process?
-   Was her anxiety/interest in the women's superstition about "blockage" based on her personal feelings and fears about being pregnant one day, or was it just from a scientific/anthropologist view of seeing it as rituals and beliefs of another culture?
-   Considering Abu-Lughod writes about wishing she had the support system of the Egyptian women when having given birth, why was she reluctant to first try their natural and superstitious remedies to infertility, before trying IVF? If all of these women have had so many children, and have so much knowledge to share with her, why does she not trust their advance and try it out, before relying on technology, doctors and petri-dish fertilization?

I think Abu-Lughod was trying to be open to the possibility that different cultural practices might work, even though they weren't the ones she was used to. She's also trying to point out that Western biomedicine is itself a culture, in spite of its claims to be perfectly scientific, with its own weird rituals and forms of suffering. In that sense, this is a standard comparative ethnography, where she uses her own experience as a way of getting to conduct research.

Abu-Lughod is also making a point about doing research on women. She explains that she had previously ignored women's pregnancies, not "counting them" as part of her earlier work on women's experience. Here she's instead declaring that pregnancy *ought* to be a valid ethnographic object (which it certainly is).

As far as her various mixed feelings about the different rituals: "I could never help being awed by people's insistence that amulets were powerful and should never touch the ground or be thrown away. In matters mysterious, like religion and reproduction, one finds oneself uncertain enough to be half willing to "go native"."
