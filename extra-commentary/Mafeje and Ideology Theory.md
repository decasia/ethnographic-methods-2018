# Questions about Mafeje, Eagleton and Ideology Theory

## Why ideology

- Is it correct to assume, based on the readings that there is a power dynamic attached to ideologies that determine? I was a little bit unclear on this point.
- How does a culture's ideology shape an individual within that culture? 
- How people ascribe meaning to things to create culture? 
- Is it acceptable to still continue using terms such as tribe, just because the people spoken about uses it themselves ? 
- Is there a distinct difference between what society may consider a norm within itself and a societal ideology? 
- Why are ideologies important to people?
- If anyone's ideology is not set up by society is it still considered an ideology?
- How exactly does one determine what the dominant ideology of a society is? Is it the ideology that influences the most political decisions or the ideology held by the masses? This distinction seems important because in an autocratic society, the ideology held by those in power and the ideology held by majority of society might be polar opposites.
- Would we be able to get some comparisons between the two authors? 
- Can you provide a comparison on the definitions of ideology between the two readings in the context that they refer to?

A few points about this.

Comparatively speaking, Mafeje is *using the category of ideology for analysis* while Eagleton is *trying to clarify what the term ideology refers to*. In practice, Mafeje uses some of Eagleton's definitions more than others. At one point Mafeje draws on the classical Marxist definition of ruling-class ideology; he also has in mind a more general theory of ideology as something that mystifies and obscures our understanding of the world.

I don't actually think it's useful to say that there is *one single dominant ruling ideology.* There are various dominant ideologies, and the way to identify them is by looking at who has the most power and what sorts of ideas they are trying to get everyone else to accept. It's absolutely true that there are normally *many* competing ideologies held by different groups in society.

The relationship between *ideologies* and *norms* is very interesting. Briefly, norms tell you *how to behave* and ideologies tell you *why to behave.* They are conceptually distinct but closely related. (This also explains why ideologies matter to people -- because they need rationalizations for why they should go through the motions that society expects from them.)

It is absolutely right that ideologies are inseparable from systems of power and authority. But again, as we have just been saying, dominated people have ideologies too.

## Questions about Mafeje's "The ideology of tribalism"

- Can’t one say that the reason because people aren’t as informed by tribes and the reason for people regarding it as strange is because it is unfamiliar to them and what they are use to? 
- The Mafeje article addresses that anthropologists spoke about 'social change' after 1945. What exactly does this 'social change' refer to, if Gluckman contradicted his own stance on it?
- Mafeje: What characteristics or practices does a society or community have to possess in order for it to be classified as an actual tribe? How do you know whether a society is an actual tribe and regard themselves as a tribe, or whether it is only a label given by colonial anthropologists? Is the concept of tribe actually just one of opinion?
- Mafeje states that the problem in Africa is not the diversified behaviours of its citizens, but the ideology of tribalism. How can an any ideology on tribalism be a one way street? Many people may agree on one thing, but the manner in which they came to the conclusion may differ. In this light, I can not believe that ideologies of tribalism is one of our continent's major problems. 
- Mafeje writes about the issue of using the word “tribe” to describe an African community, and the negative repercussions that follow, as the words tribe/tribal holds an air of inferiority, or as undeveloped. Therefore, what would the reaction have been on both African communities and how they’re viewed, as well as in the academic world, if African communities were considered instead as “states” or “towns” (western titles for a community). 
- Should people stop using the term as tribe, or linking importance to the term, if it is irrelevant in today’s society? Would it be better to attach significance to cultural affiliation, rather than tribal? 


Mafeje's thought is that maybe the word "tribe" could be not completely useless if you were studying a small isolated group: "A relatively undifferentiated society, practising a primitive subsistence economy and enjoying local autonomy, can legitimately be designated as a tribe" (258). Of course there are practically no such societies at this point. Mafeje thinks that today there are people who *draw on tribalist ideology* for political ends. Europeans use tribalist ideas to stigmatize Africa; whereas Mafeje notes that some Africans use tribalist ideas as a tool in urban political projects. Urban life and the capitalist economy incidentally are things that Mafeje has in mind in talking about social change, along with colonialist indirect rule.

It's not a requirement of anthropological analysis that we either systematically accept or reject people's own way of understanding their existence. It all depends on the exact situation. Mafeje makes a strong argument that we stop using "tribe" as an analytical category and, at most, study the way that non-anthropologists still talk about tribes -- as an ideology of their own.

## The Ethnographer's Ideology

- When a researcher already has a preconceived notion of the group of people he/she wants to study how unreliable does it make the research? and how can it be avoided?
- Is it not hard as the ethnographer to partake in field work about subjects that she has such common links to due to herself also being a woman and therefore identifying with her subject on a deeper level. 
- To what extent are social scientists like Anthropologists bound by the terminology that has always been used when writing ethnography?
- Mafeje's discussion of ideology talks about how western/colonial ideas have affected our perception of African "tribes". In what other ways must we decolonize our understanding in regards to African anthropological knowledge, and in what ways has this already been done by researchers?

Actually, we can't avoid having preconceived ideas about the people we study. What we can do is check whether our preconceived ideas *stand up to scrutiny* and examine the *political implications of our work.* (We can also change our terminology if we find that it is problematic.)

It's fine to have a deep identification with what we study. Analysis is an *activity* that anyone can undertake — if you seriously do the work of research and analysis, you will develop your thinking beyond its point of departure, no matter where you set out from. We all set out from somewhere.

The question about how to decolonize anthropology in Africa is a huge question. I hope some answers to it will come out from the various readings and topics in our class.

## Pedagogical feedback

- The Eagleton reading is extremely long winded, would it be possible for a more condensed version stating the point more clearly.
- Is Eagleton's piece an ethnography? 

Eagleton's piece is pure conceptual analysis, not an ethnography. And yes, Eagleton says a number of important things, but next year I will see about finding a more condensed version of the argument.

## Miscellaneous

- Are the cultures which are imposed on Africa by outsiders worth the tourism they may bring or are we simply allowing others to oversimplify and undermine Africa?

This is actually a question for public debate rather than anthropological analysis!
